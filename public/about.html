<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Background and Education</h2>

<p>
My name is Gift Muchai. I was boing on the 7th of octomber Kenya in a county called Bungoma in town called Webuye.
I spent most of my childhood [from the age 3 years to late 15 years old] living with my GrandMa- Selina Masoni the mother to my mum,
Maureen masoni. I went to the folling primary schools:

<ol>
  <li>Kindergarten and junior academy</li>
  <Li>Comple Hope academy</Li>
  <li>Hakika hope academy</li>
  <Li>Then back to Comple Hope academy</Li>
  <li>Malava boys' high school</li>
</ol>

I finished my primary educaion at Compel Hope Academy in 2018. I managed to score 354 marks out of 500-Grade B+.
i got;

<ul>
  <li>Mathematic 81% A</li>
  <li>Science 73% B+</li>
  <li>Social studies and RE 74% B+</li>
  <li>english 69% B</li>
  <li>Kiswahili 59% C+</li>
</ul>

Later joined Highschool which is known as Malava boys' High school in 2019 January, i had a dream of becoming a civil engineer
that's enough to tell that I liked Maths, Physics and Geography. But along the way i started liking Music and Computer so i told myself that if 
I don't become a civil engineer i would like to be a Music producer or a Programer which was my 3rd and last option.
Unfortunately, I only studied at Malava for only 2 year before coming to the uk- where my mother was.

<h2>Finally in the UK</h2>

<p>
I arrived in Heathrow Airport on the 16th October 2021. Here is where my stress began, I had just turned 16 years old so there was no room
for me to do my Gcses' and couldn't join college since it was like 6 weeks after  enrolments. luckylu, gota job at Phone repair shop called The 
Repair centre in Chesterfield market hall. Here, I learnt how to repair phones to pass time as i was waiting for the next college enrolment.
Fast forward in 2022 September I got a chance to join Chesterfield college, in the first year i was doing level 1 Media then on the same year joined
level 2 Digital and Business and also Maths and English because i had no Gcses', With hopes of doing Programming in Level 3 .
Finaly, I did my Gcses' butfom there life to a turn as i failed my English and the level 2 Digital and Business so i couldn't do Programming anymore.
Below is what i got in my Gcses;

<li>Maths got grade 5</li>
<li>English grade 3. The required grade was 4. Unfortunately failed bya mark</li>

And my Course were as following;
<li>Emerging tech Grade Pass</li>
<li>Creating website Grade Merit</li>
<li>Mobile app creation Grade Distinction</li>
<li>Create a programme Grade Distinction</li>
<li>Cyber security Grade fail</li>
<li>Pitching the app grade Merit</li>
Overall was a Merit.

Failed the course becuse of one fail in the Course, I was sad and didn't ant to go back to the college, I kept going to my parttime job and saved up some
money which was need to renew our visas [my mum and I]. Ended up droppng out of college, I had nothing to do and didn't want to repaire phones all my life.
So I decided to watch youtube videos and learn how people who didn't attend college or university managed t become web developers.
I joined <a href="https://www.udemy.com/"> Udemy</a> and found a web developing course paid and this is how I learnt web developing.
